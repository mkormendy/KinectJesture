Kinect Jesture for Mac
======================

This is a fork of the original KinectJesture by Takashi Nishibayashi https://github.com/hagino3000/KinectJesture, used to ontrol the mouse cursor and fire the key events (right or left).

This is an attempt to provide a more robust and up-to-date version of code for this project in xcode 5 for Apple OS X.
Also this will attempt to provide a bit of documentation for compiling and building the software, but there are no guarantees.
